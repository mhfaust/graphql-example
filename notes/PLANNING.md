TUESDAY EVENING:
Conceive of a good example case 
Imagine a web-app that lets user navigate the entities, back and forth
draw out a nice graph -- nodes and lines (nodes: boxes with entity names, type o'thing)
This will be used to highlight he advantage of graphql over rest
- don't need new endpoints for each use caes
- evolving presentation requirements may be met by simply changing the shape of the query in the FE.
