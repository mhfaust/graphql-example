    text: `Black holes are a paradox. They are paradoxical because 
      they simultaneously must exist but can’t, and so they break 
      physics as we know it. Many physicists will tell you that the 
      best way to fix broken physics is with string. String theory, 
      in fact. And in the black holes of string theory - fuzzballs - 
      are perhaps even weirder than the regular type.`,

    text: `Entropy is surely one of the most perplexing 
      concepts in physics. It’s variously described as a 
      measure of a system’s disorder - or as the amount of 
      useful work that you can get from it - or as the information 
      hidden by the system. Despite the seeming ambiguity in its 
      definition, many physicists hold entropy to be behind one of 
      the most fundamental laws of physics.`,
